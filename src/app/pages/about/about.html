          I discovered design when I was working in the Dominican Republic as a community health worker. Realizing its potential for resource-challenged communities, I challenged myself to learn how to create products that were intentionally designed to make lives easier.
          <br><br>I'm passionate about user experience, software development, and helping make products that make us happier people. 
          <br><br>I enjoy pretending to play soccer like Cristiano Ronaldo, reading gritty non-fiction about history, and playing my Nintendo Switch! You'll often find me designing and coding for open-source projects <span role="emoji">ðŸ˜Š</span>
