## About 
This is my UX portfolio built in Angular 6

## Angular Framework

Angular is a TypeScript-based open-source front-end web application platform led by the Angular Team at Google and by a community of individuals and corporations. Those powerful capabilities are brought to Angular because it provides mobile-friendly `HTML`, `JS`, and `CSS` components to developers.

## Bulma

[Bulma](https://bulma.io/) is a free, open source CSS framework based on Flexbox.
